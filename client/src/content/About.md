## What is Sweatless?
Sweatless is a tool for tracking your training workouts in a quick and easy way while giving you the ability to customize what you want to track without much hassle. It is based on my experience with using Google Sheets for this purpose and bundles the functionality I needed for my strength and running workouts into a simpler and cleaner user interface.

Conceptually it is a **complement to your usual running-/sports-tracking mobile apps** which give you a lot of quantitative metrics of individual activities and visualisations of those but lack in the qualitative dimension i.e. what training goal a workout actually has. Even when you don't have particularly ambitious goals you will quickly come to a point where you don't do the same kind of training every time (e.g. slow runs that are longer and faster ones over a short distance). Only when you pair your individual workouts with the other numbers you get **information that is actually useful**. Now you can answer questions like *"Did I neglect my high-intensity workouts last month?"* with ease. This is why the core of Sweatless are **configurable training types**. Your entire log history is calculated into a handful of percentages and totals that help you decide what to do on the day without following a strict plan. They also provide some visualisation of your progress to help keep you motivated without overdoing metrics-based self-analysis. Another function that I found very useful is being able to combine your logs quickly and easily with free text notes. Especially when you are having injury problems this can be very revealing and **helpful when talking to doctors**.

Feel free to [contact me](#contactinfo-heading) with ideas for improvement.

## And how does it work?

Sweatless is an offline-first web app that **stores your data locally in your browsers built-in database** . None of it is sent to a server or processed anywhere else so **your privacy remains untouched** and you can **use the entire app without internet connection** . Sweatless is built as a personal project and has no commercial purpose so there are also no ad trackers etc.

**Having your data in the browser also means that you will erase your data when you clear your website-data in the browser settings, use the app in private/icognito mode or uninstall your browser entirely. Be sure to [backup your logs](/settings#export-section) before you do that. You can then import them back into the app.**

To not lock your data in but give you the ability to take it, for example, into a spread sheet (like Google Sheets or Excel) there is also the option to [export your logs as a CSV file](/settings#export-section).
